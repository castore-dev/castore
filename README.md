# Making Event Sourcing easy 😎

[Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) is a data storage paradigm that saves **changes in your application state** rather than the state itself.

It is powerful as it enables **rewinding to a previous state** and **exploring audit trails** for debugging or business/legal purposes. It also integrates very well with [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture).

However, it is **tricky to implement** 😅

After years of using it at [Kumo](https://dev.to/kumo), we have grown to love it, but also experienced first-hand the lack of consensus and tooling around it. That's where Castore comes from!

---

<p align="center">
  Castore is a TypeScript library that <b>makes Event Sourcing easy</b> 😎
</p>

---

With Castore, you'll be able to:

- Define your [event stores](#--eventstore)
- Fetch and push new [events](#--events) seamlessly
- Implement and test your [commands](#--command)
- ...and much more!

All that with first-class developer experience and minimal boilerplate ✨

## 🫀 Core Design

Some important decisions that we've made early on:

### 💭 **Abstractions first**

Castore has been designed with **flexibility** in mind. It gives you abstractions that are meant to be used **anywhere**: React apps, containers, Lambdas... you name it!

For instance, `EventStore` classes are **stack agnostic**: They need an `EventStorageAdapter` class to interact with actual data. You can code your own `EventStorageAdapter` (simply implement the interface), but it's much simpler to use an off-the-shelf adapter like [`DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter`](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/README.md).

### 🙅‍♂️ **We do NOT deploy resources**

While some packages like `DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter` require compatible infrastructure, Castore is not responsible for deploying it.

Though that is not something we exclude in the future, we are a small team and decided to focus on DevX first.

### ⛑ **Full type safety**

Speaking of DevX, we absolutely love TypeScript! If you do too, you're in the right place: We push type-safety to the limit in everything we do!

If you don't, that's fine 👍 Castore is still available in Node/JS. And you can still profit from some nice JSDocs!

### 📖 **Best practices**

The Event Sourcing journey has many hidden pitfalls. We ran into them for you!

Castore is opiniated. It comes with a collection of best practices and documented anti-patterns that we hope will help you out!

## 🎬 Getting Started

### - Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @castore/core

# yarn
yarn add @castore/core
```

### - Packages structure

Castore is not a single package, but a **collection of packages** revolving around a `core` package. This is made so every line of code added to your project is _opt-in_, wether you use tree-shaking or not.

Castore packages are **released together**. Though different versions may be compatible, you are **guaranteed** to have working code as long as you use matching versions.

Here is an example of working `package.json`:

```js
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@castore/core": "1.3.1",
    "@castore/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter": "1.3.1"
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@castore/test-tools": "1.3.1"
    ...
  }
}
```

## 🚀 The Basics

### - `Events`

Event Sourcing is all about **saving changes in your application state**. Such changes are represented by **events**, and needless to say, they are quite important 🙃

Events that concern the same entity (like a `Pokemon`) are aggregated through a common id called `aggregateId` (and vice versa, events that have the same `aggregateId` represent changes of the same business entity). The index of an event in such a serie of events is called its `version`.

![Events](./assets/docsImg/events.png)

In Castore, stored events (also called **event details**) always have exactly the following properties:

- <code>aggregateId <i>(string)</i></code>
- <code>version <i>(integer ≥ 1)</i></code>
- <code>timestamp <i>(string)</i></code>: A date in ISO 8601 format
- <code>type <i>(string)</i></code>: A string identifying the business meaning of the event
- <code>payload <i>(?any = never)</i></code>: A payload of any type
- <code>metadata <i>(?any = never)</i></code>: Some metadata of any type

```ts
import type { EventDetail } from '@castore/core';

type PokemonAppearedEventDetail = EventDetail<
  'POKEMON_APPEARED',
  { name: string; level: number },
  { trigger?: 'random' | 'scripted' }
>;

// 👇 Equivalent to:
type PokemonAppearedEventDetail = {
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  timestamp: string;
  type: 'POKEMON_APPEARED';
  payload: { name: string; level: number };
  metadata: { trigger?: 'random' | 'scripted' };
};
```

### - `EventType`

Events are generally classified in **events types** (not to confuse with TS types). Castore lets you declare them via the `EventType` class:

```ts
import { EventType } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonAppearedEventType = new EventType<
  'POKEMON_APPEARED',
  { name: string; level: number },
  { trigger?: 'random' | 'scripted' }
>({ type: 'POKEMON_APPEARED' });
```

Note that we only provided TS types for `payload` and `metadata` properties. That is because, as stated in the [core design](#-core-design), **Castore is meant to be as flexible as possible**, and that includes the validation library you want to use: The `EventType` class is not meant to be used directly, but rather implemented by other classes which will add run-time validation methods to it 👍

- [Zod Event Type](./packages/zod-event/README.md)

> >;
> // => EventTypeDetail<typeof pokemonAppearedEventType>
> // | EventTypeDetail<typeof pokemonCatchedEventType>
> ```
>
> </details>

### - `Aggregate`

Eventhough entities are stored as series of events, we still want to use a **simpler and stable interface to represent their states at a point in time** rather than directly using events. In Castore, it is implemented by a TS type called `Aggregate`.

> ☝️ Think of aggregates as _"what the data would look like in CRUD"_

In Castore, aggregates necessarily contain an `aggregateId` and `version` properties (the `version` of the latest `event`). But for the rest, it's up to you 🤷‍♂️

For instance, we can include a `name`, `level` and `status` properties to our `PokemonAggregate`:

```ts
import type { Aggregate } from '@castore/core';

// Represents a Pokemon at a point in time
interface PokemonAggregate extends Aggregate {
  name: string;
  level: number;
  status: 'wild' | 'catched';
}

// 👇 Equivalent to:
interface PokemonAggregate {
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  name: string;
  level: number;
  status: 'wild' | 'catched';
}
```

### - `Reducer`

Aggregates are derived from their events by [reducing them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) through a `reducer` function. It defines **how to update the aggregate when a new event is pushed**:

![Aggregate](./assets/docsImg/aggregate.png)

```ts
import type { Reducer } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonsReducer: Reducer<PokemonAggregate, PokemonEventDetails> = (
  pokemonAggregate,
  newEvent,
) => {
  const { version, aggregateId } = newEvent;

  switch (newEvent.type) {
    case 'POKEMON_APPEARED': {
      const { name, level } = newEvent.payload;

      // 👇 Return the next version of the aggregate
      return {
        aggregateId,
        version,
        name,
        level,
        status: 'wild',
      };
    }
    case 'POKEMON_CATCHED':
      return { ...pokemonAggregate, version, status: 'catched' };
    case 'POKEMON_LEVELED_UP':
      return {
        ...pokemonAggregate,
        version,
        level: pokemonAggregate.level + 1,
      };
  }
};

const myPikachuAggregate: PokemonAggregate =
  myPikachuEvents.reduce(pokemonsReducer);
```

> ☝️ Aggregates are always **computed on the fly**, and NOT stored. Changing them does not require any data migration whatsoever.

### - `EventStore`

Once you've defined your [event types](#--eventtype) and how to [aggregate](#--reducer) them, you can bundle them together in an `EventStore` class.

Each event store in your application represents a business entity. Think of event stores as _"what tables would be in CRUD"_, except that instead of directly updating data, you just append new events to it!

![Event Store](./assets/docsImg/eventStore.png)

In Castore, `EventStore` classes are NOT responsible for actually storing data (this will come with [event storage adapters](#--eventstorageadapter)). But rather to provide a boilerplate-free and type-safe interface to perform many actions such as:

- Listing aggregate ids
- Accessing events of an aggregate
- Building an aggregate with the reducer
- Pushing new events etc...

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonsEventStore = new EventStore({
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS',
  eventStoreEvents: [
    pokemonAppearedEventType,
    pokemonCatchedEventType,
    pokemonLeveledUpEventType,
    ...
  ],
  reduce: pokemonsReducer,
});
// ...and that's it 🥳
```

> ☝️ The `EventStore` class is the heart of Castore, it even gave it its name!

### - `EventStorageAdapter`

For the moment, we didn't provide any actual way to store our events data. This is the responsibility of the `EventStorageAdapter` class.

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonsEventStore = new EventStore({
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS',
  eventTypes: pokemonEventTypes,
  reduce: pokemonsReducer,
  // 👇 Provide it in the constructor
  storageAdapter: mySuperStorageAdapter,
});

// 👇 ...or set/switch it in context later
pokemonsEventStore.storageAdapter = mySuperStorageAdapter;
```

You can choose to [build an event storage adapter](./docs/building-your-own-event-storage-adapter.md) that suits your usage. However, we highly recommend using an off-the-shelf adapter:

- [DynamoDB Event Storage Adapter](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/README.md)
- [Redux Event Storage Adapter](./packages/redux-event-storage-adapter/README.md)
- [In-Memory Event Storage Adapter](./packages/inmemory-event-storage-adapter/README.md)

If the storage solution that you use is missing, feel free to create/upvote an issue, or contribute 🤗

### - `Command`

Modifying the state of your application (i.e. pushing new events to your event stores) is done by executing **commands**. They typically consist in:

- Fetching the required aggregates (if not the initial event of a new aggregate)
- Validating that the modification is acceptable
- Pushing new events with incremented versions

![Command](./assets/docsImg/command.png)

```ts
import { Command, tuple } from '@castore/core';

type Input = { name: string; level: number };
type Output = { pokemonId: string };
type Context = { generateUuid: () => string };

const catchPokemonCommand = new Command({
  commandId: 'CATCH_POKEMON',
  // 👇 "tuple" is needed to keep ordering in inferred type
  requiredEventStores: tuple(pokemonsEventStore, otherEventStore),
  // 👇 Code to execute
  handler: async (
    commandInput: Input,
    [pokemonsEventStore, otherEventStore],
    // 👇 Additional context arguments can be provided
    { generateUuid }: Context,
  ): Promise<Output> => {
    const { name, level } = commandInput;
    const pokemonId = generateUuid();

    await pokemonsEventStore.pushEvent({
      aggregateId: pokemonId,
      version: 1,
      type: 'POKEMON_CATCHED',
      payload: { name, level },
    });

    return { pokemonId };
  },
});
```

Note that we only provided TS types for `Input` and `Output` properties. That is because, as stated in the [core design](#-core-design), **Castore is meant to be as flexible as possible**, and that includes the validation library you want to use: The `Command` class is not meant to be used directly, but rather extended by other classes which will add run-time validation methods to it 👍

A few notes on commands handlers:

- `Commands` handlers should NOT use [read models](#--read-models) when validating that a modification is acceptable. Read models are like cache: They are not the source of truth, and may not represent the freshest state.

- Fetching and pushing events non-simultaneously exposes your application to [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). To counter that, commands are designed to be retried when an `EventAlreadyExistsError` is triggered (which is part of the `EventStorageAdapter` interface).

![Command Retry](./assets/docsImg/commandRetry.png)

- Command handlers should be, as much as possible, [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). If it depends on impure functions like functions with unpredictable outputs (like id generation), mutating effects, side effects or state dependency (like external data fetching), you should pass them through the additional context arguments rather than directly importing and using them. This will make them easier to test and to re-use in different contexts, such as in the [React Visualizer](./packages/react-visualizer/README.md).

- Finally, when writing on several event stores at once, it is important to make sure that **all events are written or none**, i.e. use transactions: This ensures that the application is not in a corrupt state. Transactions accross event stores cannot be easily abstracted, so check you adapter library on how to achieve this. For instance, the [`DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter`](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/README.md) exposes a [`pushEventsTransaction`](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/src/utils/pushEventsTransaction.ts) util.

## 💪 Advanced usage

### - Event-driven architecture

Event Sourcing integrates very well with [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture). In a traditional architecture, you would need design your system events (or **messages** for clarity) separately from your data. With Event Sourcing, they can simply **broadcast the business events you already designed**.

There are two kinds of messages:

- **Notification messages** which only carry events details
- **State-carrying messages** which also carry their corresponding aggregates

In Castore, they are implemented by the `NotificationMessage` and `StateCarryingMessage` TS types:

```ts
// NotificationMessage
import type {
  NotificationMessage,
  EventStoreNotificationMessage,
} from '@castore/core';

type PokemonEventNotificationMessage = NotificationMessage<
  'POKEMONS',
  PokemonEventDetails
>;

// 👇 Equivalent to:
type PokemonEventNotificationMessage = {
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS';
  event: PokemonEventDetails;
};

// 👇 Also equivalent to:
type PokemonEventNotificationMessage = EventStoreNotificationMessage<
  typeof pokemonsEventStore
>;

// StateCarryingMessage
import type {
  StateCarryingMessage,
  EventStoreStateCarryingMessage,
} from '@castore/core';

type PokemonEventStateCarryingMessage = StateCarryingMessage<
  'POKEMONS',
  PokemonEventDetails,
  PokemonAggregate
>;

// 👇 Equivalent to:
type PokemonEventStateCarryingMessage = {
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS';
  event: PokemonEventDetails;
  aggregate: PokemonAggregate
};

// 👇 Also equivalent to:
type PokemonEventStateCarryingMessage = EventStoreStateCarryingMessage<
  typeof pokemonsEventStore
>;
```

Both kinds of messages can be published to [Message Queues](#--messagequeue) or [Message Buses](#--messagebus).

### - `MessageQueue`

[Message Queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) store the published messages until they are handled by a **worker**. The worker is unique and predictible. It consumes all messages indifferently of their content.

![Message Queue](./assets/docsImg/messageQueue.png)

You can use the `NotificationMessageQueue` or the `StateCarryingMessageQueue` classes to implement message queues:

```ts
import { NotificationMessageQueue } from '@castore/core';

const appMessageQueue = new NotificationMessageQueue({
  messageQueueId: 'APP_MESSAGE_QUEUE',
  sourceEventStores: [pokemonsEventStore, trainersEventStore],
});

await appMessageQueue.publishMessage({
  // 👇 Typed as NotificationMessage of one of the source event stores
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS',
  event: {
    type: 'POKEMON_LEVELED_UP',
    // ...
  },
});

// Same usage for StateCarryingMessageQueues
```

### - `MessageQueueAdapter`

Similarly to event stores, `MessageQueue` classes provide a boilerplate-free and type-safe interface to publish messages, but are NOT responsible for actually doing so. This is the responsibility of the `MessageQueueAdapter`, that will connect it to your actual messaging solution:

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const messageQueue = new NotificationMessageQueue({
  ...
  // 👇 Provide it in the constructor
  messageQueueAdapter: mySuperMessageQueueAdapter,
});

// 👇 ...or set/switch it in context later
messageQueue.messageQueueAdapter = mySuperMessageQueueAdapter;
```

You can code your own `MessageQueueAdapter` (simply implement the interface), but we highly recommend using an off-the-shelf adapter:

- [SQS Message Queue Adapter](./packages/sqs-message-queue-adapter/README.md)
- [In-Memory Message Queue Adapter](./packages/in-memory-message-queue-adapter/README.md)

If the messaging solution that you use is missing, feel free to create/upvote an issue, or contribute 🤗

The adapter packages will also expose useful generics to type the arguments of your queue worker. For instance:

```ts
import type {
  SQSMessageQueueMessage,
  SQSMessageQueueMessageBody,
} from '@castore/sqs-message-queue-adapter';

const appMessagesWorker = async ({ Records }: SQSMessageQueueMessage) => {
  Records.forEach(({ body }) => {
    // 👇 Correctly typed!
    const recordBody: SQSMessageQueueMessageBody<typeof appMessageQueue> =
      JSON.parse(body);
  });
};
```

### - `MessageBus`

[Message Buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) are used to spread messages to multiple **listeners**. Contrary to message queues, they do not store the message or wait for the listeners to respond. Often, **filter patterns** can also be used to trigger listeners or not based on the message content.

![Message Bus](./assets/docsImg/messageBus.png)

You can use the `NotificationMessageBus` or the `StateCarryingMessageBus` classes to implement message buses:

```ts
import { NotificationMessageBus } from '@castore/core';

const appMessageBus = new NotificationMessageBus({
  messageBusId: 'APP_MESSAGE_BUSES',
  sourceEventStores: [pokemonsEventStore, trainersEventStore...],
});

await appMessageBus.publishMessage({
  // 👇 Typed as NotificationMessage of one of the source event stores
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS',
  event: {
    type: 'POKEMON_LEVELED_UP',
    ...
  }
})

// Same usage for StateCarryingMessageBus
```

### - `MessageBusAdapter`

Similarly to event stores, `MessageBus` classes provide a boilerplate-free and type-safe interface to publish messages, but are NOT responsible for actually doing so. This is the responsibility of the `MessageBusAdapter`, that will connect it to your actual messaging solution:

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const messageBus = new NotificationMessageBus({
  ...
  // 👇 Provide it in the constructor
  messageBusAdapter: mySuperMessageBusAdapter,
});

// 👇 ...or set/switch it in context later
messageBus.messageBusAdapter = mySuperMessageBusAdapter;
```

You can code your own `MessageBusAdapter` (simply implement the interface), but we highly recommend using an off-the-shelf adapter:

- [EventBridge Message Bus Adapter](./packages/event-bridge-message-bus-adapter/README.md)
- [In-Memory Message Bus Adapter](./packages/in-memory-message-bus-adapter/README.md)

If the messaging solution that you use is missing, feel free to create/upvote an issue, or contribute 🤗

The adapter packages will also expose useful generics to type the arguments of your bus listeners. For instance:

```ts
import type { EventBridgeMessageBusMessage } from '@castore/event-bridge-message-bus-adapter';

const pokemonMessagesListener = async (
  // 👇 Specify that you only listen to the pokemonsEventStore messages
  eventBridgeMessage: EventBridgeMessageBusMessage<
    typeof appMessageQueue,
    'POKEMONS'
  >,
) => {
  // 👇 Correctly typed!
  const message = eventBridgeMessage.detail;
};
```

### - `ConnectedEventStore`

If your storage solution exposes data streaming capabilities (such as [DynamoDB streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html)), you can leverage them to push your freshly written events to a message bus or queue.

You can also use the `ConnectedEventStore` class. Its interface matches the `EventStore` one, but successfully pushing a new event will automatically forward it to a message queue or bus:

```ts
import { ConnectedEventStore } from '@castore/core';

const connectedPokemonsEventStore = new ConnectedEventStore(
  // 👇 Original event store
  pokemonsEventStore,
  // 👇 Type-safe (appMessageBus MUST be able to carry pokemon events)
  appMessageBus,
);

// Will push the event in the event store
// ...AND publish it to the message bus if it succeeds 🙌
await connectedPokemonsEventStore.pushEvent({
  aggregateId: pokemonId,
  version: 2,
  type: 'POKEMON_LEVELED_UP',
  ...
});
```

If the message bus or queue is a state-carrying one, the `pushEvent` method will re-fetch the aggregate to append it to the message before publishing it. You can reduce this overhead by providing the previous aggregate as an option:

```ts
await connectedPokemonsEventStore.pushEvent(
  {
    aggregateId: pokemonId,
    version: 2,
    ...
  },
  // 👇 Aggregate at version 1
  { prevAggregate: pokemonAggregate },
  // Removes the need to re-fetch 🙌
);
```

![Connected Event Store](./assets/docsImg/connectedEventStore.png)

Compared to data streams, connected event stores have the advantage of simplicity, performances and costs. However, they **strongly decouple your storage and messaging solutions**: Make sure to anticipate any issue that might arise (consistency, non-catched errors etc.).

### - Snapshotting

As events pile up in your event stores, the performances and costs of your commands can become an issue.

One solution is to periodially persist **snapshots** of your aggregates (e.g. through a message bus listener), and only fetch them plus the subsequent events instead of all the events.

Snapshots are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned 🙂

### - Read Models

Even with snapshots, using the event store for querying needs (like displaying data in a web page) would be slow and inefficient, if not impossible depending on the access pattern.

In Event Sourcing, it is common to use a special type of message bus listener called **projections**, responsible for maintaining data specifically designed for querying needs, called **read models**.

Read models allow for faster read operations, as well as re-indexing. Keep in mind that they are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) by design, which can be annoying in some use cases (like opening a resource page directly after its creation).

Read models are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned 🙂
