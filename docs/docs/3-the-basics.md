# 🚀 The Basics

## `Events`

Event Sourcing is all about **saving changes in your application state**. Such changes are represented by **events**, and needless to say, they are quite important 🙃

Events that concern the same entity (like a `Pokemon`) are aggregated through a common id called `aggregateId` (and vice versa, events that have the same `aggregateId` represent changes of the same business entity). The index of an event in such a serie of events is called its `version`.

![Events](../assets/docSchemas/events.png)

In Castore, stored events (also called **event details**) always have exactly the following properties:

- <code>aggregateId <i>(string)</i></code>
- <code>version <i>(integer ≥ 1)</i></code>
- <code>timestamp <i>(string)</i></code>: A date in ISO 8601 format
- <code>type <i>(string)</i></code>: A string identifying the business meaning of the event
- <code>payload <i>(?any = never)</i></code>: A payload of any type
- <code>metadata <i>(?any = never)</i></code>: Some metadata of any type

```ts
import type { EventDetail } from '@castore/core';

type PokemonAppearedEventDetail = EventDetail<
  'POKEMON_APPEARED',
  { name: string; level: number },
  { trigger?: 'random' | 'scripted' }
>;

// 👇 Equivalent to:
type PokemonAppearedEventDetail = {
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  timestamp: string;
  type: 'POKEMON_APPEARED';
  payload: { name: string; level: number };
  metadata: { trigger?: 'random' | 'scripted' };
};
```

## `EventType`

Events are generally classified in **events types** (not to confuse with TS types). Castore lets you declare them via the `EventType` class:

```ts
import { EventType } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonAppearedEventType = new EventType<
  'POKEMON_APPEARED',
  { name: string; level: number },
  { trigger?: 'random' | 'scripted' }
>({ type: 'POKEMON_APPEARED' });
```

Note that we only provided TS types for `payload` and `metadata` properties. That is because, as stated in the [core design](/docs/introduction#-core-design), **Castore is meant to be as flexible as possible**, and that includes the validation library you want to use (if any): The `EventType` class can be used directly if no validation is required, or implemented by other classes which will add run-time validation methods to it 👍

See the following packages for examples:

- [JSON Schema Event Type](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/json-schema-event)

>   [typeof pokemonAppearedEventType, typeof pokemonCaughtEventType]
> >;
> // => EventTypeDetail<typeof pokemonAppearedEventType>
> // | EventTypeDetail<typeof pokemonCaughtEventType>
> ```
>
> </details>

## `Aggregate`

Eventhough entities are stored as series of events, we still want to use a **simpler and stable interface to represent their states at a point in time** rather than directly using events. In Castore, it is implemented by a TS type called `Aggregate`.

> ☝️ Think of aggregates as _"what the data would look like in CRUD"_

In Castore, aggregates necessarily contain an `aggregateId` and `version` properties (the `version` of the latest `event`). But for the rest, it's up to you 🤷‍♂️

For instance, we can include a `name`, `level` and `status` properties to our `PokemonAggregate`:

```ts
import type { Aggregate } from '@castore/core';

// Represents a Pokemon at a point in time
interface PokemonAggregate extends Aggregate {
  name: string;
  level: number;
  status: 'wild' | 'caught';
}

// 👇 Equivalent to:
interface PokemonAggregate {
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  name: string;
  level: number;
  status: 'wild' | 'caught';
}
```

## `Reducer`

Aggregates are derived from their events by [reducing them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) through a `reducer` function. It defines **how to update the aggregate when a new event is pushed**:

![Aggregate](../assets/docSchemas/aggregate.png)

```ts
import type { Reducer } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonsReducer: Reducer<PokemonAggregate, PokemonEventDetails> = (
  pokemonAggregate,
  newEvent,
) => {
  const { version, aggregateId } = newEvent;

  switch (newEvent.type) {
    case 'POKEMON_APPEARED': {
      const { name, level } = newEvent.payload;

      // 👇 Return the next version of the aggregate
      return {
        aggregateId,
        version,
        name,
        level,
        status: 'wild',
      };
    }
    case 'POKEMON_CAUGHT':
      return { ...pokemonAggregate, version, status: 'caught' };
    case 'POKEMON_LEVELED_UP':
      return {
        ...pokemonAggregate,
        version,
        level: pokemonAggregate.level + 1,
      };
  }
};

const myPikachuAggregate: PokemonAggregate =
  myPikachuEvents.reduce(pokemonsReducer);
```

> ☝️ Aggregates are always **computed on the fly**, and NOT stored. Changing them does not require any data migration whatsoever.

## `EventStore`

Once you've defined your [event types](#eventtype) and how to [aggregate](#reducer) them, you can bundle them together in an `EventStore` class.

Each event store in your application represents a business entity. Think of event stores as _"what tables would be in CRUD"_, except that instead of directly updating data, you just append new events to it!

![Event Store](../assets/docSchemas/eventStore.png)

In Castore, `EventStore` classes are NOT responsible for actually storing data (this will come with [event storage adapters](#eventstorageadapter)). But rather to provide a boilerplate-free and type-safe interface to perform many actions such as:

- Listing aggregate ids
- Accessing events of an aggregate
- Building an aggregate with the reducer
- Pushing new events etc...

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonsEventStore = new EventStore({
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS',
  eventStoreEvents: [
    pokemonAppearedEventType,
    pokemonCaughtEventType,
    pokemonLeveledUpEventType,
    ...
  ],
  reduce: pokemonsReducer,
});
// ...and that's it 🥳
```

## `EventStorageAdapter`

For the moment, we didn't provide any actual way to store our events data. This is the responsibility of the `EventStorageAdapter` class.

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const pokemonsEventStore = new EventStore({
  eventStoreId: 'POKEMONS',
  eventTypes: pokemonEventTypes,
  reduce: pokemonsReducer,
  // 👇 Provide it in the constructor
  storageAdapter: mySuperStorageAdapter,
});

// 👇 ...or set/switch it in context later
pokemonsEventStore.storageAdapter = mySuperStorageAdapter;
```

You can choose to build an event storage adapter that suits your usage. However, we highly recommend using an off-the-shelf adapter:

- [DynamoDB Event Storage Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter)
- [Redux Event Storage Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/redux-event-storage-adapter)
- [In-Memory Event Storage Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/inmemory-event-storage-adapter)

If the storage solution that you use is missing, feel free to create/upvote an issue, or contribute 🤗

## `Command`

Modifying the state of your application (i.e. pushing new events to your event stores) is done by executing **commands**. They typically consist in:

- Fetching the required aggregates (if not the initial event of a new aggregate)
- Validating that the modification is acceptable
- Pushing new events with incremented versions

![Command](../assets/docSchemas/command.png)

```ts
import { Command, tuple } from '@castore/core';

type Input = { name: string; level: number };
type Output = { pokemonId: string };
type Context = { generateUuid: () => string };

const catchPokemonCommand = new Command({
  commandId: 'CATCH_POKEMON',
  // 👇 "tuple" is needed to keep ordering in inferred type
  requiredEventStores: tuple(pokemonsEventStore, trainersEventStore),
  // 👇 Code to execute
  handler: async (
    commandInput: Input,
    [pokemonsEventStore, trainersEventStore],
    // 👇 Additional context arguments can be provided
    { generateUuid }: Context,
  ): Promise<Output> => {
    const { name, level } = commandInput;
    const pokemonId = generateUuid();

    await pokemonsEventStore.pushEvent({
      aggregateId: pokemonId,
      version: 1,
      type: 'POKEMON_CAUGHT',
      payload: { name, level },
    });

    return { pokemonId };
  },
});
```

Note that we only provided TS types for `Input` and `Output` properties. That is because, as stated in the [core design](/docs/introduction#-core-design), **Castore is meant to be as flexible as possible**, and that includes the validation library you want to use (if any): The `Command` class can be used directly if no validation is required, or implemented by other classes which will add run-time validation methods to it 👍

A few notes on commands handlers:

- `Commands` handlers should NOT use [read models](/docs/advanced-usage#read-models) when validating that a modification is acceptable. Read models are like cache: They are not the source of truth, and may not represent the freshest state.

- Fetching and pushing events non-simultaneously exposes your application to [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). To counter that, commands are designed to be retried when an `EventAlreadyExistsError` is triggered (which is part of the `EventStorageAdapter` interface).

![Command Retry](../assets/docSchemas/commandRetry.png)

- Finally, Command handlers should be, as much as possible, [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). If it depends on impure functions like functions with unpredictable outputs (like id generation), mutating effects, side effects or state dependency (like external data fetching), you should pass them through the additional context arguments rather than directly importing and using them. This will make them easier to test and to re-use in different contexts, such as in the [React Visualizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/react-visualizer).

## Event Groups

Some commands can have an effect on several event stores, or on several aggregates of the same event store. For instance, the `CATCH_POKEMON` command could write both a `CAUGHT_BY_TRAINER` event on a pokemon aggregate (changing its `status` to `'caught'`) and a `POKEMON_CAUGHT` event on a trainer aggregate (appending the `pokemonId` to its `pokedex`).

![Event Group](../assets/docSchemas/eventGroup.png)

To not have your application in a corrupt state, it's important to make sure that **all those events are pushed or none**. In Castore, this can be done through the **event groups** API:

- You can use the `groupEvent` method to build an array of events that are to be pushed together. It has the same input interface as `pushEvent` but synchronously returns a `GroupedEvent` class.
- The `EventStore` class exposes a static `pushEventGroup` method that can be used to effectively push this event group.

```ts

Like the `pushEvent` API, event groups are designed to throw an `EventAlreadyExistsError` if the transaction has failed, making sure that commands are retried as expected when race conditions arise.

> ☝️ When pushing event groups on several event stores, they must use the same type of event storage adapters.
>
> ☝️ Also, be aware of technical constraints of your event storage solution. For instance, the [`DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter)'s implementation is based on [DynamoDB transactions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/transaction-apis.html), which means that the event stores tables must be in the same region, and that a groups cannot contain more than 100 events.
