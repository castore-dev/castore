# Introduction

## Making Event Sourcing easy 😎

[Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) is a data storage paradigm that saves **changes in your application state** rather than the state itself.

It is powerful as it enables **rewinding to a previous state** and **exploring audit trails** for debugging or business/legal purposes. It also integrates very well with [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture).

However, it is **tricky to implement** 😅

After years of using it at [Kumo](https://dev.to/kumo), we have grown to love it, but also experienced first-hand the lack of consensus and tooling around it. That's where Castore comes from!

With Castore, you'll be able to:

- Define your [event stores](../the-basics#eventstore)
- Fetch and push new [events](../the-basics#events) seamlessly
- Implement and test your [commands](../the-basics#command)
- ...and much more!

All that with first-class developer experience and minimal boilerplate ✨

## 🫀 Core Design

Some important decisions that we've made early on:

### 💭 **Abstractions first**

Castore has been designed with **flexibility** in mind. It gives you abstractions that are meant to be used **anywhere**: React apps, containers, Lambdas... you name it!

For instance, `EventStore` classes are **stack agnostic**: They need an `EventStorageAdapter` class to interact with actual data. You can code your own `EventStorageAdapter` (simply implement the interface), but it's much simpler to use an off-the-shelf adapter like [`DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter`](../resources/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/).

### 🙅‍♂️ **We do NOT deploy resources**

While some packages like `DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter` require compatible infrastructure, Castore is not responsible for deploying it.

Though that is not something we exclude in the future, we are a small team and decided to focus on DevX first.

### ⛑ **Full type safety**

Speaking of DevX, we absolutely love TypeScript! If you do too, you're in the right place: We push type-safety to the limit in everything we do!

If you don't, that's fine 👍 Castore is still available in Node/JS. And you can still profit from some nice JSDocs!

### 📖 **Best practices**

The Event Sourcing journey has many hidden pitfalls. We ran into them for you!

Castore is opiniated. It comes with a collection of best practices and documented anti-patterns that we hope will help you out!
