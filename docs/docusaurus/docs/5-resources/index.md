## Test Tools

Castore comes with a handy [Test Tool package](./packages/test-tools/README.md) that facilitates the writing of unit tests: It allows mocking event stores, populating them with an initial state and resetting them to it in a boilerplate-free and type-safe way.

## React Visualizer

Castore also comes with a handy [React Visualizer](./packages/react-visualizer/README.md) library: It exposes a React component to visualize, design and manually test Castore event stores and commands.

## Packages List

### Event Types
